# Assignments Week 1
# Introduction
This assignment aims to get you started in coding with Python, but you can also use any other programming language you prefer. Specifically, you will calculate protein properties for all proteins in the theoretical proteome of an organism of your choice. The goal is to get an overview of how certain protein properties are distributed across a proteome.  
# Input data
Download a reference proteome for an organism of your choice from UniProt. Use that .fasta file as input file.
Tasks and output files
1)	Calculate the molecular weight for all proteins of the proteome that you have downloaded. Save results as an output file, e.g. as a .csv file.
2)	Calculate the isoelectric point for all proteins of the proteome that you have downloaded. Save results as an output file, e.g. as a .csv file.
3)	Calculate the hydrophobicity/GRAVY score for all proteins of the proteome that you have downloaded. Save results as an output file, e.g. as a .csv file.
4)	Plot the distribution of values (i.e. the values for all proteins in the proteome) for at least one of these protein properties. You can also plot multiple properties against each other. Feel free to be creative. Save the plot in an appropriate format.
5)	Make sure to comment your code, so that others can read and understand it easily. 
6)	Create (or modify) a README file describing how to run your code. Include requirements (e.g. Python packages that need to be installed) in that description, or as a separate requirements.txt file.
7)	Commit all your input files, scripts, and result files to your GitHub Classroom repository.
# Submission
You must submit the assignment through GitHub Classroom by 8 am January 26 to get full credit. 
# Bonus Credit
8)	Use a prediction tool (e.g. DeepTMHMM, or SignalP 6) to predict the localization/secretion of all proteins in the proteome. Based on these results, group the proteome into categories (e.g. cytosolic, membrane, secreted, â€¦) and compare the hydrophobicity distributions for each of those categories by plotting them together.
